TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you are on a computer previously registered by Dr. Aymond, you might need
to release the old key.  If the License Manager appears with the old key
visible, highlight it and choose "Release Key".  Then follow the steps above.

You can also open license manager from the menu.  Click the "Start" tab of
the ribbon menu (near the top left), then click the "Register" button which
is in the help section on the right of the Start ribbon menu.
