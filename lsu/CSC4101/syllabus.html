<h1 id="course-summary">Course Summary</h1>
<p>Principles of programming language design; specification of syntax 
and semantics; underlying implementation of block structured languages; 
dynamic memory allocation for strings, lists, and arrays; imperative 
versus applicative programming; logic programming; modern programming 
languages.</p>
<h1 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h1>
<p>According to the course listing, the prerequisites are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CSC 3102: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="course-format">Course Format</h1>
<p>We will use the flipped classroom teaching model. I will make 
lectures available as videos for you to watch at your own time. During 
regular class times, I will answer questions about the lecture content, 
homeworks, and programming assignments and, if needed, go over 
additional examples. I will also record these classes and make the 
videos available afterwards. The amount of class time we will need for 
that will depend on what is happening in the lectures and with the 
programming assignments. Occasionally (rarely) we might skip class, but 
it will also be rare that we will need the full class period.</p>

<h1 id="programming-assignments">Programming Assignments</h1>
<p>There will be three programming assignments, which will be due at 
midnight (11:59pm) of the due date. The due dates will normally be at 
the end of a week. The first two programming assignments will be in 
Python. The third programming assignment will be in Scheme. The first 
two programming assignments will be in teams of two, the third will be 
done individually. Since all program assignments are submitted and 
graded on a Linux server, submissions must be compatible with the 
language versions installed there. There will also be small programming 
problems, such as 1-10 liners in Scheme, ML or F#, and Prolog as parts 
of homeworks.</p>
<p>A penalty of 10% will be assessed for each day a project is late up 
to a maximum of 30% after which it will not be accepted. The final 
project may not be turned in later than Saturday midnight after the last
 day of classes.</p>
<h1 id="homeworks">Homeworks</h1>
<p>There will be five homework assignments, which will be due at 
midnight (11:59pm) on the due date. The due dates will normally be on a 
day on which we have class. Homeworks will be submitted as PDF files 
(scanned or converted from images) on <a href="https://moodle.lsu.edu/pluginfile.php/354911/mod_resource/content/5/gradescope.com">gradescope.com</a>. A penalty of 20% will be assessed if a homework is submitted two days late. Homeworks later than that will not be accepted.</p>
<h1 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h1>
<p>There will be several short (about 5-10 minute) quizzes on Moodle, 
which are normally due at the end of the week. The purpose of the 
quizzes is to ensure you stay on track with watching the lecture 
material. I expect that we will have approximately 10-12 quizzes, i.e., 
nearly one per week.</p>
<h1 id="annotated-bibliography">Annotated Bibliography</h1>
<p>Honors students who want to honorize this course as well as graduate 
students also must submit an annotated bibliography on a programming 
language research topic as an additional assignment.</p>
<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<p>The following weights will be used for grading. The quizzes all weigh
 equally. The homeworks all weigh equally. The first two projects are 
worth 13% each, while the third project is worth 10%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Projects: 36%<br>
Homeworks: 15%<br>
Bibliography: 3%<br>
Quizzes: 5%<br>
Midterm: 20%<br>
Final: 24%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For honors and graduate students the maximum score with the 
bibliography assignment is 103 points. Before computing the letter 
grades, that total score is then divided by 1.03.</p>
<p>The course will be graded partly on a curve. For this reason, I will 
deduct points rather liberally and I will encourage the grader to do the
 same. Don’t be too upset if you don’t get what you consider to be a 
high score. When grading on a curve the absolute score is not that 
important. To give you an idea of where you are standing in class, 
statistics about the scores will be provided periodically.</p>
<p>In the past, the letter grade cutoffs have been usually in 15 point 
increments. Depending on the difficulty of the exams and the strictness 
of grading, the cutoffs might be moved down a little. After that, each 
letter grade range will be divided into three parts for +/- grades. 
E.g., the cutoffs for the major letter grades might be 85-70-55-40.</p>
<h1 id="topics">Topics</h1>
<p>This list of topics is an ordering of subjects that will be covered 
with the corresponding assignments. Each topic will roughly take a week 
and a half, with a bit less time for topics 1 and 10.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Functional Programming, Scheme, HW 1</li>
<li>Syntax and Parsing, HW 2</li>
<li>OO Programming, Project 1</li>
<li>OO Language Design, Midterm</li>
<li>Types and Scopes, HW 3</li>
<li>Functions and Parameter Passing, HW 4</li>
<li>Function Implementation, Project 2</li>
<li>Functional Programming, ML or F#, HW 5</li>
<li>Logic Programming, Prolog, Project 3</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="due-dates-and-grading">Due Dates and Grading</h1>
<p>The time allotted for each homework assignment will be made quite 
generous, as such, the penalty for turning in late is high: 20% for 
turning it in in the next class period. Homeworks need to be submitted 
as paper copies, not electronically.</p>
<p>Since the time needed for finishing a programming assignment is 
harder to estimate and to allow fixing severe bugs that show up close to
 the deadline, programming assignments can be submitted up to three days
 after the official deadline. For each day past the deadline, a penalty 
of 10 percent will be incurred. Programming assignments will be 
submitted electronically. Projects will be due at midnight.</p>
<p>Without prior arrangements in case of extenuating circumstances, 
submission of homeworks and projects past the late deadline is not 
allowed, such work will not be graded, and you will receive no credit. 
It is your responsibility to make sure that you have completed your work
 with enough time to submit your materials.</p>
<p>Grading disputes can be submitted in writing with accompanying 
documentation, or in person during regular office hours. It is course 
policy that whoever graded the work will be responsible for handling 
disputes. In general, I will grade the midterm exam and the final exam. 
The graders will grade the homeworks and the programming assignments. 
Grades become final one week after a homework, project, or exam is 
handed back. This should leave ample time for resolving grading 
disputes.</p>
<h1 id="homework-standards">Homework Standards</h1>
<p>All written work submitted must carry the student’s name and must be 
reasonably neat and well organized. Any work that cannot be read easily 
may score zero points. A reasonable standard of English expression and 
grammar is also required. The same requirements apply to exams.</p>
<h1 id="programming-standards">Programming Standards</h1>
<p>The algorithm used must be essentially correct. Obviously, the 
program should (compile and) run. Because of the complexity of some of 
the programs, very little or no credit can be given for a program that 
doesn’t run. If a program dumps core or throws a runtime exception, only
 partial credit will be given.</p>
<p>Since programming assignments might build on top of a previous 
project, it is very important to get each submission to run without 
runtime exceptions or core dumps and to structure the program so it can 
be easily extended.</p>
<p>I expect your work to exhibit high standards of programming style and
 layout, reflecting your expertise as a computer professional. Poor 
style and documentation may result in points being deducted.</p>
<h1 id="honesty">Honesty</h1>
<p>I will treat you as professionals, and you should plan on conducting 
yourself as such. This course presents many important concepts you will 
need throughout your career as a computing professional, so it is 
important that <em>each student</em> do <em>all</em> the assignments and projects and learn the material.</p>
<p>There will be several homework assignments and programming projects. 
You are free to discuss these assignments with others. However, the 
programs and homework solutions you submit are to be developed by 
yourself (or by your team). <em>Cheating is a very serious offense and will not be tolerated</em>.
 The grader or I may use tools for detecting cheating on programming 
assignments. Reverse-engineering the reference implementation or 
supplying others with material is also against this rule. Similarly, 
making homework solutions or code available publicly on a web site, such
 as Github, is also considered a cheating offense. I have archived 
submissions of programming assignments from previous years. Copying from
 a student from a previous year or making your code available to a 
student in the future is similarly a cheating offense. The policy is 
that the supplier and receiver of information will both be reported to 
the Dean of Students.</p>
<p>Save all handwritten notes and printouts you generate as you work on a
 project and keep them until the end of the quarter so as to protect 
yourself in the event that someone “borrows” your program, or the 
version you submit is lost.</p>
<h1 id="computer-account-security-and-use">Computer Account Security and Use</h1>
<p>To help others resist the temptation of using your work, you should 
maintain proper security on your computer account. In particular, keep 
your password from others and do not alter the protection on any of your
 files. To give others access to your account or files or printouts of 
your programs is the same as giving them the information directly and 
will be dealt with accordingly. Any trouble with computer accounts 
should be referred to an instructor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When a program has been submitted electronically, you should maintain an <em>unedited</em>
 version of what you submitted (with the correct time stamp) until after
 that program has been graded. It is also beneficial to use version 
control software such as git or CVS to keep track of all versions of 
files so you can revert back to an old version if necessary.</p>
<h1 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h1>
<p>The videos of lecture material and classes as well as any handouts 
and the skeleton code for programming assignments are the intellectural 
property of myself and LSU. It is a copyright violation to share them 
with anybody outside the class. I will make videos available on YouTube,
 but these videos will not be public. They will be unlisted vidoes on my
 YouTube channel. You can access them through the links I provide on 
Moodle, but do not share them with anybody outside the class without my 
permission and do not upload them to other sites.</p>
<h1 id="behavioral-misconduct">Behavioral Misconduct</h1>
<p>Per section 5.1 of the Code of Student Conduct, the Code applies to 
conduct that occurs on the Campus, at LSU-sponsored activities, and/or 
when the Student or RSO is representing LSU. The University shall have 
discretion to extend jurisdiction over conduct that occurs off campus 
when the conduct adversely and significantly affects the learning 
environment or University community and would be in violation of the 
Code if the conduct had occurred on campus. This includes behavior that 
may occur in a remote learning environment, such as email, discussion 
forums, zoom webinars, or any other platform or solution used for a 
course. In determining whether or not to extend jurisdiction, the 
University may consider its ability to gather information. Potential 
violations of the Code can be reported through LSU Cares.</p>
