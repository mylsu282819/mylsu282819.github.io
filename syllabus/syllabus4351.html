<h1 id="course-summary">Course Summary</h1>
<p>Program language structures, translation, loading, execution, and 
storage allocation; compilation of simple expressions and statements; 
organization of compiler including compile-time and run-time symbol 
tables, lexical scan, syntax scan, object code generation, error 
diagnostics, object code optimization techniques, and overall design; 
use of compiler writing languages and bootstrapping.</p>
<h1 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h1>
<p>According to the course listing, the prerequisites are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CSC 4101 or equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="course-format">Course Format</h1>
<p>I am planning to use the flipped classroom teaching model, where I 
will make lectures available as videos for you to watch at your own 
time. During regular class times, I will then answer questions about the
 lecture content, homeworks, and programming assignments and, if needed,
 go over additional examples. I will also record these classes and make 
the videos available afterwards. With this approach, the amount of class
 time we will need will depend on what is happening in the lectures and 
with the programming assignments. Occasionally (rarely) we might skip 
class. Since this approach is more time-consuming to develop and since I
 am teaching two classes this semester, we may occasionally use class 
time for lecture content.</p>

<p>Please, let me know by email when you are planning to connect during 
office hours, so I can space out students if needed and to make sure 
that I’m in front of the computer at that time. I will maintain a Zoom 
waiting room if needed.</p>

<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<p>There will be six programming assignments. Each will take about two to two and a half weeks.</p>
<p>A penalty of 10% will be assessed for each day a project is late up 
to a maximum of 30% after which the project will not be accepted. The 
final project may not be turned in later than Saturday midnight after 
the last day of classes.</p>
<h1 id="homeworks">Homeworks</h1>
<p>There will be four short homework assignments, which will be due at 
midnight (11:59pm) on the due date. The due dates will normally be on a 
day on which we have class. Homeworks will be submitted as PDF files 
(scanned or converted from images) on <a href="https://moodle.lsu.edu/pluginfile.php/685805/mod_resource/content/7/gradescope.com">gradescope.com</a>. A penalty of 20% will be assessed if a homework is submitted two days late. Homeworks later than that will not be accepted.</p>
<h1 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h1>
<p>There will be several short (about 5-10 minute) quizzes on Moodle, 
which are normally due at the end of a module. The purpose of the 
quizzes is to ensure you stay on track with watching the lecture 
material. I expect that we will have approximately 6-10 quizzes.</p>
<h1 id="annotated-bibliography">Annotated Bibliography</h1>
<p>Graduate students or honors students who want to honorize this course must submit an annotated bibliography on a compiler topic.</p>
<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<p>The following weights will be used for grading. The quizzes all weigh
 equally. Similarly, the homeworks and projects will all weigh equally, 
respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Projects: 42%<br>
Homeworks: 8%<br>
Bibliography: 3%<br>
Quizzes: 5%<br>
Midterm: 20%<br>
Final: 25%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For honors and graduate students the maximum score with the 
bibliography assignment is 103 points. Before computing the letter 
grades, that total score is then divided by 1.03.</p>
<p>The course will be graded partly on a curve. For this reason, I will 
deduct points rather liberally and I will encourage the grader to do the
 same. Don’t be too upset if you don’t get what you consider to be a 
high score. When grading on a curve the absolute score is not that 
important. To give you an idea of where you are standing in class, 
statistics about the scores will be provided periodically.</p>
<p>In the past, the letter grade cutoffs have been usually in 15 point 
increments. Depending on the difficulty of the exams and the strictness 
of grading, the cutoffs might be moved down a little. After that, each 
letter grade range will be divided into three parts for +/- grades. 
E.g., the cutoffs for the major letter grades might be 85-70-55-40.</p>
<h1 id="topics">Topics</h1>
<p>This list of topics is an ordering of subjects that will be covered 
with the corresponding book chapters and assignments. Each topic will 
roughly take a week and a half, with a bit less time for topics 1 and 9.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compiler Structure: Ch 1</li>
<li>Lexical Analysis: Ch 2, Proj 1, HW 1</li>
<li>Parsing and Abstract Syntax: Ch 3 &amp; 4, Proj 2, HW 2</li>
<li>Semantic Analysis: Ch 5, Proj 3</li>
<li>Activation Records: Ch 6, Proj 4</li>
<li>Intermediate Code: Ch 7, Proj 5, HW 3</li>
<li>Canonicalization: Ch 8, HW 4</li>
<li>Instruction Selection: Ch 9, Proj 6</li>
<li>Liveness Analysis and Register Allocation: Ch 10, 11 &amp; 12</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="due-dates-and-grading">Due Dates and Grading</h1>
<p>The time allotted for each homework assignment will be at least one 
week. The penalty for turning in late is 20 percent by the next class 
period. After that homeworks will not be accepted. I am planning to 
experiment with using Gradescope for simplifying the grading of exams 
and homeworks. If we get Gradescope set up for homework submissions, 
then you would upload scans of your homework to Gradescope. Otherwise, 
homeworks will be submitted on paper in class.</p>
<p>Since the time needed for finishing a programming assignment is 
harder to estimate and to allow fixing severe bugs that show up close to
 the deadline, programming assignments can be submitted up to three days
 after the official deadline. The last programming assignment cannot be 
submitted later than by Saturday midnight after the last day of classes.
 For each day past the deadline, a penalty of 10 percent will be 
incurred. Programming assignments will be submitted electronically and 
will be due at midnight. We will not accept submissions more than three 
days after the due date.</p>
<p>Without prior arrangements in case of extenuating circumstances, submission of homeworks and project past the late deadline is <em>not</em> allowed and such work will <em>not</em> be graded and you will receive <em>no</em>
 credit. It is your responsibility to make sure that you have completed 
your work with enough time to submit your materials. For projects, make 
sure that you verify that your code was submitted correctly.</p>
<p>Grading disputes can be submitted in writing with accompanying 
documentation, or in person during regular office hours. It is course 
policy that whoever graded the work will be responsible for handling 
disputes. In general, I will grade the midterm exam and the final exam. 
The grader will grade the homeworks and the programming assignments. 
Grades become final one week after a homework, project, or exam is 
handed back. This should leave ample time for resolving grading 
disputes. This rule will be strictly enforced, groveling for a point 
here and a point there at the end of the quarter will do you no good!</p>
<h1 id="homework-standards">Homework Standards</h1>
<p>All written work submitted must carry the student’s name and must be 
reasonably neat and well organized. Any work that cannot be read easily 
will score zero points. A reasonable standard of English expression and 
grammar is also required. The same requirements apply to exams.</p>
<h1 id="programming-standards">Programming Standards</h1>
<p>The algorithm used must be essentially correct. Obviously, the 
program should compile and run. Because of the complexity of some of the
 programs, no credit may be given for a program that doesn’t run. If a 
program throws a run-time exception, only partial credit will be given.</p>
<p>Since projects build on top of previous projects, it is very 
important to get each submission to run without run-time exceptions and 
to structure the program so it can be easily extended.</p>
<p>I expect your work to exhibit high standards of programming style and
 layout, reflecting your expertise as a computer professional. Poor 
style and documentation may results in up to 10% deducted.</p>
<h1 id="honesty">Honesty</h1>
<p>I will treat you as professionals, and you should plan on conducting 
yourself as such. This course presents many important concepts you will 
need throughout your career as a computing professional, so it is 
important that <em>each student</em> do <em>all</em> the assignments and projects and learn the material.</p>
<p>There will be several homework assignments and programming projects. 
You are free to discuss these assignments with others. However, the 
programs and homework solutions you submit are to be developed by 
yourself (or by your team). <em>Cheating is a very serious offense and will not be tolerated</em>.
 The grader or I will use tools for detecting cheating on programming 
assignments. Reverse-engineering the reference implementation or 
supplying others with material is also against this rule. Similarly, 
making homework solutions or code available publicly on a web site, such
 as Github, is also considered a cheating offense. The policy is that 
the supplier and receiver of information will both be reported to the 
Dean of Students.</p>
<p>Save all handwritten notes or printouts you generate as you work on a
 project and keep them until the end of the semester so as to protect 
yourself in the event that someone “borrows” your program, or the 
version you submit is mislaid.</p>
<h1 id="computer-account-security-and-use">Computer Account Security and Use</h1>
<p>To help others resist the temptation of using your work, you should 
maintain proper security on your computer account. Especially, keep your
 password from others and do not alter the protection on any of your 
files. To give others access to your account or files or printouts of 
your programs is the same as giving them the information directly and 
will be dealt with accordingly. Any trouble with computer accounts 
should be referred to an instructor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When a program has been submitted electronically, you should maintain an <em>unedited</em>
 version of what you submitted (with the correct date stamp) until after
 that program has been graded. It is also beneficial to use version 
control software such as git or CVS to keep track of all versions of 
files so you can revert back to an old version if necessary.</p>
<h1 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h1>
<p>The videos of lecture material and classes as well as any handouts 
and the skeleton code for programming assignments are the intellectural 
property of myself and LSU. It is a copyright violation to share them 
with anybody outside the class. I will make videos available on YouTube,
 but these videos will not be public. They will be unlisted vidoes on my
 YouTube channel. You can access them through the links I provide on 
Moodle, but do not share them with anybody outside the class without my 
permission and do not upload them to other sites.</p>
<h1 id="behavioral-misconduct">Behavioral Misconduct</h1>
<p>Per section 5.1 of the Code of Student Conduct, the Code applies to 
conduct that occurs on the Campus, at LSU-sponsored activities, and/or 
when the Student or RSO is representing LSU. The University shall have 
discretion to extend jurisdiction over conduct that occurs off campus 
when the conduct adversely and significantly affects the learning 
environment or University community and would be in violation of the 
Code if the conduct had occurred on campus. This includes behavior that 
may occur in a remote learning environment, such as email, discussion 
forums, zoom webinars, or any other platform or solution used for a 
course. In determining whether or not to extend jurisdiction, the 
University may consider its ability to gather information. Potential 
violations of the Code can be reported through LSU Cares.</p>
